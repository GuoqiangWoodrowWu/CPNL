# CPNL
This repository implements the CPNL method, proposed in our following paper:  
Guoqiang Wu, Yingjie Tian, and Dalian Liu. "Cost-sensitive multi-label learning with positive and negative label pairwise correlations." Neural Networks 108 (2018): 411-423.
## Run
run the demo.m in MATLAB, CPNL will run as its default parameters on sample datasets.
